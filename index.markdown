The mission of Missing Children Minnesota is to support families through personal safety 
educational programs for children and to provide support and referral services to the families of 
missing children. 

We envision a world where all young people in the state of Minnesota have the skills and 
resources to be safe. Caregivers have the resources to nurture, guide, and protect their young 
people.

Since 1983 Missing Children Minnesota has helped more than 3500 families and children throughout the Midwest by providing 24-hour advocacy and support services, as well as helping families at risk for abduction create individualized prevention plans.

In addition to search assistance, we also provide four critically acclaimed educational programs to children and adults throughout Minnesota and all across the country. Every year, MCM presents abduction prevention and personal safety programs to schools, daycare centers, early childhood and family education groups, churches and childrenâ€™s vacation camps.

We hope that by providing children with the information they need to be safer this year, we will have fewer missing children next year.

Please browse through our site to learn more about personal safety for children and teens. We always love to speak with kids and parents, so call or email us with your comments and questions!
